# Anagrams
An 'anagram' is defined as a 'word formed by rearranging the letters of another,  such as cinema, formed from iceman.' Write a function that, given two words, returns 1 if the two words are anagrams, 0  otherwise.
Examples:
'anagram', 'raganam' -> 1
'listen', 'silent' -> 1
'meal', 'mole' -> 0
'happy', 'sad' -> 0
You can assume that all inputs are single words (no spaces or special characters) 
and all lowercase. As a hint, think about the relationship between the number of 
each character in a set of words that are anagrams.
